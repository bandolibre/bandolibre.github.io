// A fixed block of R rows pinned to the TOP of the screen, refreshed in place

// known, so no terminal-height query is needed: the region is set as
// "\033[{R+1};r" (omitted bottom param => the terminal's last line on xterm and
// most others). The dashboard is overdrawn with absolute cursor moves + clear-
// to-end-of-line, so there is no full-screen clear and thus no flicker.
//
// Per frame: console_dash_begin(), one console_dash_println() per row (in the
// order rows should stack), then console_dash_end(). The frame is self-contained
// (saves/restores the cursor), so logs printed between frames scroll normally in
// the region below and never collide with the dashboard.

// the row count changed, and restore the cursor into the scrolling region.
