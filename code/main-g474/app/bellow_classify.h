/* Classifies a (signed) reading into PUSH/NEUTRAL/PULL around a center, with a
 * deadzone and hysteresis so a resting reading never chatters between states.
 *
 * Transitions (using push side as example, pull is symmetric):
 *   From NEUTRAL: enter PUSH when value < push_edge = center - dead/2 - hyst/2
 *   From PUSH:    return to NEUTRAL when value >= push_edge + hyst
 *
 * So "dead" sets the half-span of the zone between the two return-to-NEUTRAL
 * thresholds, and "hyst" is the extra travel required to leave NEUTRAL in the
 * first place (entry threshold = dead/2 + hyst/2 from center).
 *
 * Intensity is 0 at the entry edge (push_edge) and 1024 at full_push/full_pull.
 * Pass full_push = full_pull = 0 to skip intensity (direction-only use). */
