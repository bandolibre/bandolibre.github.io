/* Live-metrics scheduler. The dashboard is the fixed top block of the console

 * property system (timing/enable) and the console: it owns the per-iteration
 * frame bracket so main.c stays terse and console.c stays property-agnostic.

 * Main loop wiring:
 *   report_begin();        // opens a frame if one is due; publishes g_report_due
 *   ...polls render their show_* section while g_report_due...
 *   report_end();          // closes/tears down the frame
